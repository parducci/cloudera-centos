# Cloudera Playbook 

An Ansible Playbook that installs the Cloudera stack on RHEL/CentOS

# Running the playbook

* Setup an [Ansible Control Machine](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html) 
* Create Ansible configuration (optional):

```ini
$ vi ~/.ansible.cfg

[defaults]
# disable key check if host is not initially in 'known_hosts'
host_key_checking = False

[ssh_connection]
# if True, make ansible use scp if the connection type is ssh (default is sftp)
scp_if_ssh = True
```

* Create [Inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html) of cluster hosts:

```ini
$ vi ~/ansible_hosts

[scm_server]
<host>        license_file=/path/to/cloudera_license.txt

[db_server]
<host>

[krb5_server]
<host>        default_realm=<REALM>

[utility_servers:children]
scm_server
db_server
krb5_server

[gateway_servers]
<host>        host_template=HostTemplate-Gateway role_ref_names=HDFS-HTTPFS-1

[master_servers]
<host>        host_template=HostTemplate-Master1
<host>        host_template=HostTemplate-Master2
<host>        host_template=HostTemplate-Master3

[worker_servers]
<host>
<host>
<host>

[worker_servers:vars]
host_template=HostTemplate-Workers

[cdh_servers:children]
utility_servers
gateway_servers
master_servers
worker_servers
```
    
* Run playbook
 
```shell
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
    
```

Ansible communicates with the hosts defined in the inventory over SSH. It assumes youâ€™re using SSH keys to authenticate so your public SSH key should exist in ``authorized_keys`` on those hosts. Your user will need sudo privileges to install the required packages.

By default Ansible will connect to the remote hosts using the current user (as SSH would). To override the remote user name you can specify the ``--user`` option in the command, or add the following variables to the inventory:

```ini
[all:vars]
ansible_user=pythian
```

# Overriding CDH service/role configuration

The playbook uses [Cloudera Manager Templates](https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/install_cluster_template.html) to provision a cluster.
As part of the template import process Cloudera Manager applies [Autoconfiguration](https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_mc_autoconfig.html)
rules that set properties such as memory and CPU allocations for various roles.

If the cluster has different hardware or operational requirements then you can override these properties in ``group_vars/cdh_servers``. 
For example:

```
cdh_services:
  - type: hdfs        
    datanode_java_heapsize: 10737418240
```

These properties get added as variables to the rendered template's instantiator block and can be referenced from the service configs.
For example ``roles/cdh/templates/hdfs.j2``:

```json
"roleType": "DATANODE",
"configs": [{
  "name": "datanode_java_heapsize",
  "variable": "DATANODE_JAVA_HEAPSIZE"
}
```

# Backup Restore

Default location of backup is at /mnt/fuse_stor/testfile.txt. Variable can be found at

```
backup_file: testfile.txt
```
